->In pet Details:-
	1.Color is not defined.
->Db table:-
	customer_plan_history(it records the customer and plan history)

->A plan id for the customer may be more than one
and for pet it would be one.
For this now:-
	we create a table that will map the pet_plan
		fields:-
		id,plan_id,pet_id,customer_id


For Submit Forms:-
 we will use a token that if a form is submitting once with a token cannot be resubmit.

For Treatment:-

For 2 nd screen:-
